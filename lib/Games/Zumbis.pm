=head1 NAME

Games::Zumbis - How long can you survive in a zombies attack

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # install the game and its prereqs
  cpan Games::Zumibis

  # run the game
  zumbis

  # get addicted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This game started as a self-imposed challenge by the authors to get a
game written from scratch during the 11th International Free Software
Forum - Forum Internacional de Software Livre FISL - from 21 to 24
july of 2010 in Porto Alegre, Brasil.

The game was playable and subject to a small gaming competition that
took place 24 of july 15h being projected in a big screen near the
"user groups" area.

The initial game art was taken from the free tile sets from
http://silveiraneto.net and heavily modified (specially the zombie
char) by Gustavo Barbosa during the event.

The gameplay is fast, simple and addictive: You have to shot the
zombies before they touch you moving only in four directions and with
only 4 bullets in the screen. You will, inexorably, die. The question
is: How much time you survive, and how many zombies can you kill.

=head1 GAME CONTROL

You move the character with the 4 arrow keys and fire with the space
key. You might also choose between the male and female character
before re-starting the game by using the keys 1 and 2.
